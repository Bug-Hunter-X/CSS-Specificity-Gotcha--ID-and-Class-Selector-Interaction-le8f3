The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  color: green;
}

#myDiv.container {
  color: purple; 
}

/*This style declaration is causing the unexpected behavior*/
.container #myDiv {
  color: yellow;
}
```

The unexpected behavior arises from the interaction between the ID selector (`#myDiv`) and the class selector (`.container`).  The rule `.container #myDiv` has higher specificity than `#myDiv.container` even though it seems counterintuitive.  The combination of a class and an ID selector has greater precedence than only an ID selector with a class.

This can lead to unexpected styles being applied when dealing with nested elements and using ID selectors within a class or vice-versa.
