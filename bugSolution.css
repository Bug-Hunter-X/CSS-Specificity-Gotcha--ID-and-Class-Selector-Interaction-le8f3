The solution involves understanding and adjusting CSS specificity.  Here's how we can solve the problem:

To ensure that `#myDiv.container` takes precedence, we can use more specific selectors or adjust the order of declarations. 

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  color: green;
}

#myDiv.container {
  color: purple;
}

/* Removed conflicting selector */

```

By removing the conflicting selector `.container #myDiv`, we correctly apply the `purple` color to `#myDiv` when it has the `.container` class.  Alternatively, we could've used a more specific selector to override it,  but this solution provides a cleaner approach.
